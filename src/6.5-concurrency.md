# Chapter 6.5. Concurrency Bug Detection
**TOBE ADDED (expected date: 2025-06-30)**

Rust claims it has the feature of "Fearless Concurrency". However, it is still hard to prevent concurrency bugs in practice. This module is designed to detect potential cocurrency bugs.

Specifically, RAP now focus on these types of concurrency bugs:

- Lifetime-related bug on locks, i.e. unexpected double-lock or unexpected unlock
- (To be added)

**This module is still under development**.



## Usage

To detect concurrency bugs, use the command below in the same directory as cargo.toml

```
cargo rap -conc
```
