## Chapter 6.1. Dangling Pointer Detection

Rust is an emerging programming language that aims to prevent memory-safety bugs. However, the current design of Rust also brings side effects, which may increase the risk of memory-safety issues. In particular, it employs OBRM (ownership-based resource management) and enforces automatic deallocation of unused resources without the garbage collector. It may therefore falsely deallocate reclaimed memory and lead to use-after-free or double-free issues.

We study the problem of invalid memory deallocation and propose `SafeDrop`, a static path-sensitive data-flow analysis approach to detect such bugs. Our approach analyzes each API of a Rust crate iteratively by traversing the control-flow graph and extracting all aliases of each data-flow. To guarantee precision and scalability, we leverage a modified Tarjan algorithm to achieve scalable path-sensitive analysis, and a cache-based strategy to achieve efficient inter-procedural analysis.

Our experiment results show that our approach can successfully detect all existing CVEs of such issues with a limited number of false positives. The analysis overhead ranges from 1.0% to 110.7% in comparison with the original compilation time. We further apply our tool to several real-world Rust crates and find 8 Rust crates involved with invalid memory deallocation issues.

### POC
For the test case, we chose the same PoC as in the paper to facilitate user understanding and testing:
```rust
fn genvec() -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut s = String::from("a_tmp_string");
    let ptr = s.as_mut_ptr();
    let v;
    unsafe {
        v = Vec::from_raw_parts(ptr, s.len(), s.len());
    }
        // mem:: forgets); // do not drop s
        // otherwise, s is dropped before return
        return v;
}
fn main() {
    let v = genvec();
    // use v -> use after free
    // drop v before return â†’> double free
}
```
### SafeDrop Query
First, in the RAP backend, we embedded a Query in the compiler called `SafeDrop`.

This Query can be enabled through a command line parameter in the frontend, located in the file `compiler/rustc_interface/src/passes.rs`:
```rust
if env::var_os("RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP").is_none() && env::var_os("SAFEDROP").is_some() {
        sess.time("safedrop_check", || { tcx.hir().par_body_owners(|def_id| tcx.ensure().safedrop_check(def_id));});
}
```
The environment variable `"SAFEDROP"` is set by the front end, while `"RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP"` is used to prevent calling this query during Rustc's bootstrap process. It should only be used when analyzing third-party programs.

We have inserted the query code into `compiler/rustc_mir_transform/src/lib.rs`. This query's function body is called whenever Rust analyzes each function.
```rust
fn safedrop_check<'tcx>(tcx: TyCtxt<'tcx>, def_id: DefId) -> () {
    if let Some(_other) = tcx.hir().body_const_context(def_id.expect_local()){
        return;
    }
    if tcx.is_mir_available(def_id) {
        rap_info!("{:?}", def_id);
        let body = tcx.optimized_mir(def_id);
        let mut func_map = FuncMap::new();
        let mut safedrop_graph = SafeDropGraph::new(&body, tcx, def_id);
        safedrop_graph.solve_scc();
        safedrop_graph.safedrop_check(0, tcx, &mut func_map);
        if safedrop_graph.visit_times <= 10000{ safedrop_graph.output_warning(); }
        else{ rap_error!("SafeDrop: Over_visited: {:?}", def_id); }
    }
}
```
### Data Structure
For `SafeDrop`, the data structure `SafeDropGraph<'tcx>` maintains the context of the analysis results.

Our analyzer constructs an instance for each analyzed function, the definition is provided as follows:
```rust
pub struct SafeDropGraph<'tcx>{
    pub def_id: DefId,
    pub span: Span,
    // contains all varibles (including fields) as nodes.
    pub nodes: Vec<Node>,
    // contains all blocks in the CFG
    pub blocks: Vec<BlockNode<'tcx>>,
    pub arg_size: usize, 
    // we shrink a SCC into a node and use a father node to represent the SCC.
    pub father_block: Vec<usize>,
    // record the constant value during safedrop checking.
    pub constant_bool: FxHashMap<usize, usize>,
    // used for tarjan algorithmn.
    pub count: usize,
    // contains the return results for inter-procedure analysis.
    pub return_results: ReturnResults,
    // used for filtering duplicate alias assignments in return results.
    pub return_set: FxHashSet<(usize, usize)>,
    // record the information of bugs for the function.
    pub bug_records: BugRecords,
    // a threhold to avoid path explosion.
    pub visit_times: usize
}
```
Next, we will mainly discuss several important functions of `SafeDropGraph<'tcx>`. It is evident that the processing logic in the query is quite simple, with two key methods: `solve_scc` and `safedrop_check`.

### Graph Traversal
```rust
    safedrop_graph.solve_scc();
    safedrop_graph.safedrop_check(0, tcx, &mut func_map);
```
