# Chapter 6.4. Performance Bug Detection
This module is designed to identify performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies within a program by employing static analysis methods. After the analysis, rap will report potential code inefficiencies and their positions.

**This module is still under development.**

## Performance Bugs Supported

### Bounds checking
An example of unnecessary bounds checking is as follows.
```rust
fn foo(mut a: Vec<i32>) {
    for i in 0..a.len() {
        a[i] = a[i] + 1;
    }
}
```
Here rap will suggest replacing the safe `index` API with unsafe APIs.

## Usage
To detect such bugs, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command.
```shell
cargo rap -opt
```
