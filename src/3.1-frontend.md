# Code Analysis as Frontend 
Traditionally, performing code analysis requires modifying the compiler source code to add new passes. 
Developers then need to recompile the compiler to activate these new passes, which can be cumbersome. 
The Rust compiler offers a more portable way to conduct code analysis using the [rustc_driver](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/rustc-driver.html).
We refer to this approach as the **frontend** method because it allows developers to directly access internal compiler data and perform analysis as callbacks.
