# Chapter 1. Introduction
Writing program analysis tools is challenging. In this project, we aim to provide a user-friendly framework for developing new static program analysis features for Rust. In particular, our project integrates dozens of classic program analysis algorithms, including those for pointer analysis, control-flow analysis, interval analysis, and more. Developers can choose and combine them like Lego blocks to achieve new bug detection or verification capabilities.
